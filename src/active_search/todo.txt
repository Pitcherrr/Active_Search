Issue in get grasps that is still rotating the camera when we generate the scene, maybe need to create my own simulation function from scratch 

Add a user debug slider to alter cameras intrinsic params, probs gonna look like this:

[a b c d] * [1 0 0 0]
            [0 1 0 0]
            [0 0 1 0]
            [0 0 0 1]
